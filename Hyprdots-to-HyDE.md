# Hi! üëã Khing here.

## This fork will enhance and fix prasanthrangan/hyprdots over time.

### Why?

- Tittu (the original creator) is AFK for now, and I'm the only collaborator left. ‚ÅâÔ∏è
- My permissions are limited, so I can only merge PRs. If something breaks, I have to wait for help. üò≠
- I won‚Äôt change everything in his dotfiles out of respect.
- This repo won't **overwrite** $USER's dotfiles.

**This fork is temporary and will bridge the old structure to a newer one [coming soon...].**

### Who are the $USER?

> **NOTE**: If you're confused why every `install.sh -r` overwrites your configs, you should fork [prasanthrangan/hyprdots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots), edit the `*.lst` file, and run the script. That‚Äôs the intended way.

Who are the $USER?

‚úÖ Don‚Äôt want to maintain a fork
‚úÖ Want to stay updated with this great dotfile
‚úÖ Don‚Äôt know how the repo works
‚úÖ Don‚Äôt have time to create your own dotfiles, just use this as inspiration
‚úÖ Want a cleaner `~/.config` with everything structured like a real Linux package
‚úÖ Demands a DE like experience

### ROADMAP üõ£Ô∏èüìç

- [ ] **Portable**

  - [ ] HyDE-specific files should be imported into $USER, not the other way around
  - [ ] Keep it minimal
  - [ ] Make it packageable
  - [ ] Follow XDG specs
  - [ ] Add Makefile

- [ ] **Extensible**

  - [ ] Add HyDE extension system
  - [ ] Predictable installation

- [ ] **Performance**

  - [ ] Optimize scripts for speed and efficiency
  - [ ] Make a single CLI to manage all the core script

- [ ] **Manageable**
  - [ ] Fix scripts (shellcheck compatible)
  - [ ] Move scripts to `./lib/hyde`
  - [ ] Make `wallbash*.sh` scripts monolithic, to fix wallbash issues
- [ ] **Better Abstraction**
  - [ ] Waybar
  - [x] Hyprlock
  - [ ] ...
- [ ] Clean up
- [ ] **...**

Here's how we can update HyDE-specific Hyprland settings without changing user preferences. We don't need the "userprefs" file. Instead, we can source HyDE's hyprland.conf and make $USER prefered changes directly in the config. With this approach, won't potentially break hyde and hyde won't break your own dots.

# Why name it HyDE?

As the last man standing collaborator, I don't know what the original creator intended. But I think it's a good name. I just don't know what it stands for. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Here are some of my speculations:

- **Hy**prdots **D**otfiles **E**nhanced - Enhanced version of hyprdots when @prasanthrangan introduced wallbash as our main theme management engine.
- **Hy**prland **D**otfiles **E**xtended - Extensible Dotfiles for Hyprland.

Feel free to suggest your own meaning of HyDE. ü§î
